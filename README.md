## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before you begin

Clone this repo so you have access to the coding labs on your machine. Ideally, you should have some familiarity with:

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- React & [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Install Node

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) LTS. The `npm` CLI will be installed automatically when you install Node.js. You can easily alternate between `pnpm` & `npm`.
