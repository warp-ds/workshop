# Lab 1

**Goals for this lab:**
- Understand utility classes and how to apply them in CSS.
- Practice writing CSS with utility classes.
- Gain insight into component styling using utility classes.
- Familiarize yourself with [Warp documentation on CSS classes](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`. 
4. Open the URL provided in the console in any browser to view the React App.

## Tasks

1. **Explore Existing Styles**:
   - Open [App.tsx](../src/App.tsx) in your editor.
   - Review how styles are applied to the `header` or `main` sections.  
   - Now, try styling the `button` using utility classes similar to how the `header` is styled.
   - Refer to the [Warp documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/unocss) for guidance on CSS classes conventions and to search for available utilities.

2. **Make the Page Responsive**:
   - Add responsiveness by using breakpoints with utility classes.
   - ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** check [Warp documentation on responsive utilities](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/class-variants#available-breakpoints) for guidance.

3. **Apply Semantic Colors**:

   In Warp we use [semantic color tokens](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/tokens/intro/#semantic-colour-tokens) to apply colors to elements on the page. Those tokens are connected to semantic utility classes which are prefixed with `s-bg-`, `s-text-`, `s-border-` or `s-icon-`.
   - Add colors to different elements on the page. Try to use classes that are semantically correct.
   - ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** check the Warp documentation for a complete list of semantic utility classes for [text color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/text-color), [background color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/background-color), [border color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/border-color), and [icon color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/icon-color).

4. **Explore Additional Utilities**:
   - Experiment with other utility classes listed under the "Foundations - CSS classes" section of the [Warp documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/).
   - Apply them to various components in this app for practice.
