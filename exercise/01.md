# Lab 1

Goals for this lab:
- Become familiar with utility classes
- Become familiar with writing css using utility classes
- Gain an early understanding of what a component built using utility classes looks like
- See the documentation for Warp's CSS

## Setup
- Checkout the repo locally and do a `pnpm install`.
- Running `pnpm dev` after this should output an url on console.
- Opening that url in any browser will show you the output from React App.

## Tasks
- Open App.tsx in vscode/intellij and check how styles are added to header or main. Can you now style the button using classes from uno just how header is styled? Check out css docs on the bottom of this page to figure out the convention.
- Can you make the page responsive? Hint: Breakpoints
- Can you use semantic tokens to add colors to the page?
- Explore more utilities in our docs and try thos out in this app
