# Lab 1

**Goals for this lab:**
- Understand utility classes and how to apply them in CSS.
- Practice writing CSS with utility classes.
- Gain insight into component styling using utility classes.
- Familiarize yourself with Warp’s [documentation about CSS classes](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`. 
4. Open the URL provided in the console in any browser to view the React App.

## Tasks

1. **Explore Existing Styles**:
   - Open [App.tsx](../src/App.tsx) in your editor.
   - Review how styles are applied to the `header` or `main` sections.  
   - Now, try styling the button using UnoCSS classes similar to how the `header` is styled.
   - Refer to the [UnoCSS documentation](https://unocss.dev/) and [Warp documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/) for guidance on class conventions. You can search for classes using UnoCSS's [interactive Docs](https://unocss.dev/interactive/) or directly in the [Warp documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/).

2. **Make the Page Responsive**:
   - Add responsiveness by using breakpoints with utility classes.
   - Hint: Check [Warp’s documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/class-variants#available-breakpoints) on responsive utilities for guidance.

3. **Apply Semantic Tokens for Colors**:
   - Use [semantic color tokens](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/tokens/intro/#semantic-colour-tokens) to add colors to elements on the page.
   - See documentation for semantic color tokens for [text color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/text-color), [background color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/background-color), and [border color](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/border-color).

4. **Explore Additional Utilities**:
   - Experiment with other utility classes from the [documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/).
   - Apply them to various components in this app for practice.

For detailed CSS documentation, refer to Warp's [documentation about CSS classes](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/foundations/css-classes/unocss).
