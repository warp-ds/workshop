# Lab 2

**Goals for this lab:**
- Explore how theme switching works in WARP.
- Work with components from WARP.
- Use icons from WARP.
- Switch locales within the app.
- Review Warp’s [documentation for components](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/).

> **Note**: Warp Design System offers components for Web in [React](https://github.com/warp-ds/react), [Vue](https://github.com/warp-ds/vue), and [Web Components (Lit)](https://github.com/warp-ds/elements). This workshop uses the React package, but you can explore other frameworks if preferred.

## Setup

1. Add necessary dependencies to the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @warp-ds/react @warp-ds/icons
   ```

## Tasks
1. **Use the React Button Component**:
   - Inside the [App.tsx](../src/App.tsx) file, replace the `<button>` element with a button component from Warp.
   - Refer to [Warp's documentation for Button](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/buttons/) for guidance on importing and using it.

2. **Add an Icon**:
   - Import an icon and incorporate it within the button or another part of the app. See our [icons documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/icons/) for a list of available icons and instructions on how to import them.

3. **Switch Themes**:
   - Modify the theme in [index.html](../index.html) by changing from the current `Finn` theme to the `DBA` theme. For more information, see [Warp's Documentation on how to apply themes](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/get-started/developers/web/#_2-apply-theme).

4. **Change the Locale**:
   - Adjust the `lang` attribute in the HTML document (`index.html`) to switch the locale.
   - Test different locale codes such as `en`, `fi`, and `nb` to see the impact.

5. **Explore Additional Components**:
   - Refer to Warp’s [documentation on components](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/) to experiment with other available components in this app.
