# Lab 2

**Goals for this lab:**
- Explore how theme switching works in WARP.
- Work with components from WARP.
- Use icons from WARP.
- Switch locales within the app.
- Review Warp’s [documentation for components](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/).

> **Note**: Warp Design System offers components for Web in [React](https://github.com/warp-ds/react), [Vue](https://github.com/warp-ds/vue), and [Web Components (Lit)](https://github.com/warp-ds/elements). This workshop uses the React package, but you can explore other frameworks if preferred.

## Setup

1. Add necessary dependencies to the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm add @warp-ds/react @warp-ds/icons
   ```

## Tasks
1. **Use the React Button Component**:
   - Inside the [App.tsx](../src/App.tsx) file, replace the `<button>` element with a button component from Warp.
   - Refer to [Warp's documentation for Button](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/buttons/) for guidance on importing and using it.

2. **Add an Icon with the Box Component**:  
   - Import an icon from Warp and wrap it within a box component in the App.tsx file.
   - Refer to our [icons documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/icons/) for available icons and how to import them, and see the [Box component documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/box/) for how to use it.


3. **Switch Themes**:
   - Modify the theme in [index.html](../index.html) by changing from the current `Finn` theme to the `DBA` theme. For more information, see [Warp's Documentation on how to apply themes](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/get-started/developers/web/#_2-apply-theme).

4. **Change the Locale**:
   - Import the `TextField` component from Warp and apply the `optional` prop in the `App.tsx` file. See the [TextField component documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/textfield/#optional) for guidance on importing and using it.
   ```tsx
   <TextField label="Optional Text Field" optional />
   ```

   - Adjust the `lang` attribute in the HTML document (`index.html`) to switch the locale and run the app.
   - Test different locale codes such as `en`, `fi`, `da` and `nb` to see the impact.
   - Notice that the optional text changes depending on the value of the `lang` attribute!

5. **Explore Additional Components**:
   - Refer to Warp’s [documentation on components](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/) to experiment with other available components in this app.
