# Lab 2

Goals for this lab:
- Get an idea of how theme switching works
- Work with some components from WARP
- Work with Icons from WARP
- Switching locales
- See the documentation for Warp's Tech

## Setup
- Time to add some dependencies to this project.
- Run `pnpm add @warp-ds/react @warp-ds/icons`

## Tasks
- Open App.tsx in vscode/intellij and check how styles are added to header or main. Can you now style the button using classes from uno just how header is styled? Check out css docs on the bottom of this page to figure out the convention.
- Can you make the page responsive? Hint: Breakpoints
- Can you use semantic tokens to add colors to the page?
- Try switching themes. Theme for this app is defined in the index.html file. Switch from the current FINN theme to Tori theme.
- Try switching the locale for the page. Locale values for client side component is read from html's document lang variable. It's set to `en`, try switching to `fi` or `nb`.
- Explore more utilities in our docs and try them out in this app
